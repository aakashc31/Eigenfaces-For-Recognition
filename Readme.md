For testing, images were obtained from the BioID database at: http://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/facedb/readme.html

It contains images of different persons, under various settings of light, camera angle, etc. There are many images for every person. 
Training is done on some of the images, and testing on the rest.

Also, K-means clustering algorithm was implemented on the image database.
